My blog will be provided in both English and Chinese. If you have any suggestion or question about my blog or my articles, welcome to contact with me via Email/Facebook.

Thank you for visiting and wish you have a pleasant journey in my blog.

## About the blog’s name - Splendid

To start with, I will show the definition of “Splendid” on[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/splendid]()
> 1:  possessing or displaying splendor: as                                                              a :  shining, brilliant                                                                                                   b :  marked by showy magnificence                                                                       2:  illustrious, grand                                                                                                         3: a :  excellent \<a splendid opportunity\>                                                                       b :  being out of the ordinary :  singular

That is what I want this blog be. I will not only write down some plain experiences or introductions, but also attract visitors with my unique emotions or critics on  such things I mentioned in Welcome words. I think this blog may not be updated so frequently that may disturb my readers or occupy my whole leisure time, but every article I posted here will be sleeted carefully and to be elegant, insightful and meaningful.

我的博客取名为splendid, 这是一个我在备考GRE时学会的一个单词，意思是光辉灿烂的。我希望我的博客不至于落入俗套。博文的更新也许会很慢，因为我会对我的博文进行精心的筛选，但我希望每一片文章都足够精致、深刻，并给每一位读者散发出温暖的气息。
