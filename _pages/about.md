## Profile

Hello, welcome to Fangzheng Zou’s personal blog. I’m a student major in Economics at Nankai University, which is famous for its preeminent academic performance in the fields of Mathematic, Chemistry, Economics and History. Setting up the blog for my interest, I would share my study experience in Economics, tell stories about my university, and also reveal a different look of Shanghai, the city I lived in. My blog will be provided in both English and Chinese. If you have any suggestion or question about my blog or my articles, welcome to contact with me via Email/Facebook.
Thank you for visiting and wish you have a pleasant journey in my blog.
